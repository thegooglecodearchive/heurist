## Heurist Version 2 ##

In Heurist 2, all database structure was stored in a single database shared by individual database instances for different projects. Consequently it was not possible to give users access to modify structure, owing to the risk of corruption of existing databases - all modifications had to be made by the ACL team.

Heurist version 2 had no concept of distributed databases - all databases lived on a single server under our control. The code also grew organically as we started to work out requirements on top of what, initially, was a simple bookmarking/bibliography system.

Development of Heurist (Versions 1 and 2), from late 2005 - 2009, involved a number of technical staff including interns. In order of appearance:

Tristan Gutsche, Damian Evans, Andrew Wilson, Martin King, Tom Murtagh, Kim Jackson, Astrid Fasold, Armin Zacher, Steven Hayes, Artem Osmakov, Eric Baaij, Marco Springer, Jakob Lenk, Mirko Katreniak, Thomas Amberger, Tobias Peirick, Hannah Chamoun, Maria Shvedova, Angela Schedel, Sebastian Kahlau, Steve White, Ingrid Mason, Eileen Haupt, Johannes Mueller, Irek Golka, Maxim Nikitin.

The majority of the database structuring and programming work up to version 2 was done by Ian Johnson, Kim Jackson, Tom Murtagh, Steve White, Maria Shvedova and Artem Osmakov and associates.
