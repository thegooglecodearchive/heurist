# Introduction #

The Heurist project team is participating as a developer in the NeCTAR-funded Federated Archaeological Information Management System (FAIMS) project.

Our role is to synchronise Heurist with the FAIMS internal database structures, provide data analysis and visualisation capabilities, synchronise data with repositories such as tDAR and Open Context, and design, store and generate FAIMS tablet app configuration direct from Heurist.

We’ve just completed our first acceptance test of Heurist, and we’re delighted to say we’ve completed it, and likely passed (pending acceptance by our steering committee)

We installed the open-source version using a script I wrote, and got it running on the NeCTAR cloud (with only a few hiccups that are, even now, being ironed out.)

What’s even more exciting is that not only did it read in sample data (and horribly multi-valued data at that) but it read in our spatial data and rendered it in google maps!

And here’s one of our studious testers toiling away at the 20 page testing document… (But we gave them cookies, so our exploitation was ameliorated… a bit…)

And as this winds up, we’re starting to prepare for our beta UAT of our mobile app and our repository! Stay tuned!
