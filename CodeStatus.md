# Background #

Heurist is in active development 2013 - 2014 as part of several projects, including the NeCTAR funded Federated Archaeological Information Management System (FAIMS) and Humanities Networked Infrastructure (HuNI) projects.

The project is overseen by Ian Johnson, full time development programmers is Artem Osmakov. Arjen Lentz of Open Query and Brian-Ballsun Stanton of FAIMS are providing valuable advice to help us improve code quality and security.

Note that the different versions all operate on the same database structure, so we recommend using the latest version and temporarily switching to another version if you encounter a problem which you can't work around.

# Status update #

Ian Johnson and Artem Osmakov will be on leave over Christmas from 18th Dec - 5th Jan 2015, but will check regularly for any emails or problems with the system.

# Branches #

  * **master** will normally be a stable release, updated roughly quarterly.

  * **h3share** is our latest development version - it includes untested changes. Generally this version will be fine, and any serious non-obscure issue should be fixed within at most 1 day, as this is the version we use ourselves.

  * **archefact-xxxx** are code fixes/extensions from Arjen Lentz @ ArcheFact - branches such as these are merged into h3share after review.

  * **artem-xxxx** and similar are code fixes/extensions from Artem Osmakov, or another developer, which have not yet reached usable status.

  * **3.1.n** or similar (if available) is the stable version of the previous release. It is generally some significant distance behind h3share. Bug fixes from this version are normally incorporated into the h3share code.
