## Overview ##

Heurist (http://HeuristNetwork.org) has been developed as eResearch support infrastructure at the University of Sydney since September 2005. It is designed as a flexible web-based system which empowers researchers (and others, including undergraduate classes) to easily create new databases and develop them without programming, incorporating features such as repeatable fields, simple creation and use of relationships (record linking), automatic mapping and timelines, user-defined reports, on-the-fly record structure modification and sharing of pre-configured database schemas through a central clearinghouse.

For the more adventurous, Heurist has facilities for data import (CSV, KML etc.) including a sophisticated normalising import of complex spreadsheets, recoding, 1, 2 and 3 way crosstabulation, network diagrams and GEPHI output, feeds, blogging, annotation, constraining relationships, fuzzy date recording, hierarchichal term trees, external file linking, XSL processing, XML output streams, sophisticated reporting and publishing, addition of new analysis modules, export of structural specifications for data collection on Android mobile devices and a mobile application for delivering cultural tours. It has been adopted as a core workflow element in the Federated Archaeological Information System (FAIMS, http://fedarch.org) and as a database-on-demand function for the Humanities Networked Infrastructure (HuNI, http://huni.net.au) NeCTAR infrastructure projects.

Heurist is primarily intended to run on a Linux web server, but can also run locally or on Windows. It is running on several Ubuntu and RHEL servers including the NeCTAR Research Cloud and Amazon.

Development plans for 2014 through first quarter 2015 - see http://HeuristNetwork.org for more details - focus on further improvements to usability and customisation, including first-time user help with introductory videos; the development of well-documented downloadable data models for archaeological and historical data which will be published through FAIMS and the Heurist clearinghouse; synchronisation with other databases (FileMaker, LightRoom); improved mapping and timeline visualisation including GIS data connections; development of a plugin framework which allows customised user interfaces and localisation; further integration with FAIMS and HuNI. The major outcome of this work, Heurist Version 4, will be released in first quarter 2015.

## Audience ##
Heurist is aimed primarily at an audience of Humanities researchers who need methods for managing data digitally without having to learn programming or hire a programmer. These researchers will often identify with the Digital Humanities, but more broadly any Humanist who needs to manage research data will probably find the software useful. Heurist will also be useful for eResearch support staff who need a method to rapidly build databases for their clients - a database with half a dozen linked entity types will typically take from 2 - 5 hours, including analysis of the problem, building and basic instruction. However it is also suitable for a wide range of small database applications, including administrative applications and as a teaching tool (we have used it with small undergraduate classes in Archaeology).

## Support ##

Heurist can be easily installed on Linux servers (scripted for Ubuntu and RHEL; other flavours and Windows may require manual intervention) including virtual servers such as the Australian NeCTAR Research Cloud. For those who do not have access to a free service through their university or national research infrastructure, we can provide limited free service (below) or an at-cost share of a commercial service, or advise on commercial hosting options.

The University of Sydney supports a free Heurist service (http://heurist.sydney.edu.au) which allows people to create and use small to medium databases (small to medium in this context will depend on demand, but of the order of a few thousand records and not too much large image data). We can provide advice on database setup, as well as providing some consultancy services. We are also very keen to participate in research grant applications which plan to make use of Heurist.

## Development ##

Heurist was designed by Dr Ian Johnson, formerly Director of the Archaeological Computing Laboratory (1992 - 2008), later Arts eResearch (2008-2013, who continues to oversee development. Most of the programming has been carried out by Tom Murtagh (2005-2010) and Kim Jackson (2005-2010), Steve White (2008-2013), Artem Osmakov (2011- ongoing ), Irek Golka (graphic design, 2009-2012), but many other people have been involved as programmers and contributors including Damian Evans, Maria Shvedova, Andrew Wilson, Steven Hayes,   Martin King and numerous interns. A full history of development is provided in the wiki. Brian Balsun-Stanton and Arjen Lentz have kindly provided advice on installation and security matters.

## Status ##

Heurist is in rapid and ongoing development thanks to a number of major funded projects which use and support the infrastructure, including:

  * HuNI (Humanities Networked Infrastructure, NeCTAR funding 2013-2014, http://huni.net.au/)
  * FAIMS (Federated Archaeological Information Management System, NeCTAR funding 2013, LIEF funding 2014 - 2015 http://fedarch.org)
  * The Dictionary of Sydney (ARC Linkage grants 2005-2010 & 2010 - 2013, http://dictionaryofsydney.org)
  * Digital Harlem (ARC Discovery grants 2003-2007 & 2010-2015, http://digitalharlemblog.wordpress.com)
  * Alison Searle's project on religious conformity and conversion in early modern Britain (ARC DECRA 2012 - 2018)
  * Book of Remembrance / Beyond 1914 project, Sydney University Historian and Archives (2013 - 2015) http://beyond1914.sydney.edu.au/

and several others, as well as generous infrastructure funding from the University of Sydney.
