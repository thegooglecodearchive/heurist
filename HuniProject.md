# Overview #

Heurist provides a database-on-demand functionality for HuNI (http://huni.net.au), allowing users to create a database which is then contributed to the HuNI aggregate (subject to approval by HuNI) without the need for custom programming to create mappings and harvestable output.

The Heurist project is also developing the mappings and harvestable output to allow the Dictionary of Sydney (http:dictionaryofsydney.org)to be incorporated in the HuNI aggregate. This job was deferred due to copyright issues.

In the first and second quarters of 2014 we will be carrying out three major tasks for HuNI:

  * Establish a set of core database definitions compatible with the HuNI core ontology (published Dec 2013). Use of these core definitions will allow Heurist to generate HuNI-compatible harvestable metadata. COMPLETED
  * Develop an OAI-PMH harvestable output for ingest by HuNI COMPLETED
  * Retrofit the Dictionary of Sydney database to output HuNI harvestable metadata (older databases require retrofitting since the metadata mapping is not built in) DEPRECATED

Final acceptance of the Heurist HuNI work in Nov 2014 with the completion of a successful migration of an existing database into Heurist, using the HuNI database profile, out to harvestable files and into the HuNI aggregate.
